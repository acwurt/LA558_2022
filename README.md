 <strong> Abstract. </strong> <br>

 <i>Chernobyl Disaster, the historical Ukrainian tragedy of April 26, 1986, was the memorable event of the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant Reactor 4 explosion, known as the largest nuclear accident of both the 20 th  century and of all history. This disaster led to the displacement of around 300,000 people and resulted in an estimated range of 4,000 to 93,000 deaths. Because of this eventâ€™s notoriety and fear bias many people do not understand what exactly happened, the effects from the disaster, or how this relates to and has impacted nuclear power today. Through the use of web mapping, data visualization, and literary review, this project presents both facts and a timeline of events that took place in Chernobyl, Ukraine and the rest of the globe on April 26, 1986. The conclusion then briefly discusses modern nuclear power technologies, locations, and safety in relation to the events of the notorious Chernobyl Disaster.<i>
